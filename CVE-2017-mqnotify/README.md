This exploit was developed on kernel version 4.4.0-31-generic.  The exploit takes advantage of sleep/wakeup patterns in the mq\_notify system call to control a race condtion and obtain a UAF on a struct netlink\_sock.  This can then be leveraged to gain arbitrary read/write of 4 bytes of kernel memory.
