The save\_state function should be moved to the main exploit source file, and the build\_ropchain function should be moved to exploitlib.  Be careful to not mix up 32 bit and 64 bit registers and their sizes when merging.

Merging may be helpful once the target.mk can be made to compile the 32 bit exploit binary properly, since target.mk includes exploitlib
