In src/ is the source code for an intentionally vulnerable driver to be used when testing various vulnerabilities and exploits against them.  The vulnerable kernel module can be installed with
```sh
cd src
make
sudo insmod vuln.ko
```
A device file /proc/vuln will be created, and the vulnerabilities can be triggered by various ioctl commands on the device file


The exploits are in this directory and use ../exploitlib/exploitlib.h.  To compile a different exploit, the Makefile in this directory should be appropriately modified to match the C source file and target binary name.
