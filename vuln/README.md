In src/ is the source code for an intentionally vulnerable driver to be used when testing various vulnerabilities and exploits against them.  The vulnerable kernel module source is located in src/
It can be compiled with
```sh
make
```
The kernel module is produced in build/vuln.ko
Alternatively, the kernel module can be compiled and installed at the same time using
```sh
sudo make install
```
Root privileges are required to install a kernel module.
A device file /proc/vuln will be created, and the vulnerabilities can be triggered by various ioctl commands on the device file.

The compiled files can be cleaned with
```
make clean
```
and the vulnerable kernel module can be uninstalled while also removing all the compiled files with
```sh
sudo make remove
```
Root privileges are required to uninstall a kernel module.

The exploits are in this directory and use ../exploitlib/exploitlib.h.  To compile a different exploit, the Makefile in this directory should be appropriately modified to match the C source file and target binary name.
